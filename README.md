Twitter Sentiment Analysis | Naive Bayes Classifier 

I created this Twitter sentiment analysis for research purposes. I was interested in comparing the accuracy of a result being positive or negative when using different classifiers. In this example, I implemented Naive Bayes Classifier. I am also working with Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classifiers. 

I worked with several libraries to achieve this project such as Tweepy and NLTK


Tweepy | There are excellent tutorials in its website http://www.tweepy.org 

NLTK - Natural Language ToolKit | Please read the documentation found in its website http://www.nltk.org

In order to work with this project, you will need to have a Twitter account. Then, you need to register your client application with Twitter. Create a new application and once you are done you should have your consumer token and secret. Keep these two handy, you witll need them.
