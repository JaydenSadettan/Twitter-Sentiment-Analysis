Twitter Sentiment Analysis | Naive Bayes Classifier 

I created this Twitter sentiment analysis for research purposes.  I was interested in comparing the accuracy of a result being positive or negative when using different classifiers. In this example, I am implementing Naive Bayes Classifier. I am also working with Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classifiers.
