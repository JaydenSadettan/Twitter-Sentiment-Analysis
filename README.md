Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
==========================

Twitter Sentiment Analysis | Naive Bayes Classifier 

I created this Twitter sentiment analysis for research purposes. I am interested in comparing the accuracy of a result being positive or negative when using different classifiers. In this example, I am implementing Naive Bayes Classifier. I am also working with Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classifiers.   

I worked with several libraries to achieve this project such as Tweepy and NLTK


Tweepy | There are an excellent tutorials in its website http://www.tweepy.org to learn more about this library

Tweepy supports oauth authentication, which is handled by the tweepy.AuthHandler class


NLTK - Natural Language ToolKit 

Please read its wonderfull documentation found in its website http://www.nltk.org

In order to work with this project, you will need to have a Twitter account where you can create in https://twitter.com. Then, you need to register your client application with Twitter. Create a new application and once you are done you should have your consumer token and secret. Keep these two handy, you witll need them.
