Twitter Sentiment Analysis | Naive Bayes Classifier 

I created this Twitter sentiment analysis for research purposes. I was interested in comparing the accuracy of a result being positive or negative when using different classifiers. In this example, I implemented Naive Bayes classifier using Python, and Tweepy and NLTK libraries. Currently I am working with Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree classifiers, which I will be posting here later. 

Introduction 

Tweepy | There are excellent tutorials in its website http://www.tweepy.org 

NLTK - Natural Language ToolKit | Please read the documentation found in its website http://www.nltk.org

In order to build a Twitter sentiment analyzer, first we need to understand the right tools and methods. Machine learning is one such tool where people have developed various methods to classify. Classifiers may or may not need training data. In particular, I decided to use Naive Bayes Classifier; this classifier requires training data and therefore these methods fall under the category of supervised classification. 

Implementation Details 

- In order to work with this project, you will need to have a Twitter account. 
- Register your client application with Twitter. 
- Create a new application and once you are done you should have your consumer token and secret. 
- Keep these two handy, you will need them.
